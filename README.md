# HLS
HLS Go module implements [HTTP Live Streaming](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8216) protocol for Go. HLS can encode and decode HTTP Live Streams and also provide a tokenizer and a serializer for low level access. This HLS module does not serve HTTP live streams and it's users responsibility to serve HTTP live streams. But HLS provides helper methods to server HTTP live streams.
